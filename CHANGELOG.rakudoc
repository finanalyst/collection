=head1 2024-04-26 v0.17.4
=item add mode name as data sent to plugins, helps with directory location

=head1 2024-04-22 v0.17.1
=item add C<$proc> data to Exception message

=head1 2024-04-18 v0.17.0
=item refactor because versioning data should be handled by Collection, not C<Pod::From::Cache>
=item git type commands to get repo level and per-file versioning data is passed from a config option
=item the data is generated in the Post-Cache role, which is in Collection
=item the per-file data is added to the PodFile instance when the source is rendered, as part of the
PodFile.config data
=item C<debug-when> & C<verbose-when> were modified to take a sequence from a string, not just one file name. In line
with C<with-only>

=item the per-file data can be accessed directly as PodFile config data is automatically made
available via the C<%prm<config>> parameter.

=item the config files of the Collection and the templates will need to be changed.
=item good versioning data will not be available unless the method add-versioning-data is called
so calling for versionning will generate C<unknown> or C<Not available> rather than throwing
exceptions to ensure some backwards compatibility

=item2 instead of passing a Hash to plugin callables, the data from the plugin's config is already
stored in the data section, and so is available from the instance of ProcessedPod that is passed

each Major version. Updating is done via the plugins.conf file.

=item honour no-status in preserve-state
=item finished refresh-plugins, finalised format for 'plugins.rakuon'
